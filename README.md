## Hey, nice to meet you! 👋🏽

I'm Sebastián, but you can call me Sebas, a software developer based in Tampico, México 🇲🇽. My interest in software development started when I was 13 and created my first Android mobile app in junior high school. My career in software engineering began in 2020 with a profound fascination for coding. From that point forward, I've been on a continuous quest to deepen my knowledge, acquire new skills, and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of software development.

My career journey has equipped me with a versatile skill set, including proficiency in technologies such as React, Node.js and Firebase, and programming languages such as Swift, PHP and Python. I'm particularly passionate about web development, where I've demonstrated a track record of stunning web apps.
