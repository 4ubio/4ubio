# Hey, nice to meet you! 👋🏽

I'm Sebastián, but you can call me Sebas, a full-stack web developer based in Tampico, México 🇲🇽. My interest in software development started when I was 13 and created my first Android mobile app in junior high school. My career in software engineering began in 2020 with a profound fascination for coding. From that point forward, I've been on a continuous quest to deepen my knowledge, acquire new skills, and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of software development.
